# Curriculum Design Guidelines

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive guidelines for designing effective, structured learning modules that follow pedagogical best practices and Bloom's Taxonomy.

## Module Structure

### 1. Module Overview
- **Title**: Clear, descriptive module name
- **Duration**: Total time allocation (e.g., 5 days, 10 hours)
- **Level**: Beginner, Intermediate, or Advanced
- **Prerequisites**: Required knowledge/skills before starting
- **Learning Objectives**: 3-5 specific, measurable outcomes

### 2. Bloom's Taxonomy Integration

Tag all learning objectives and activities with appropriate Bloom's levels:

- **Remember**: Recall facts, definitions, concepts
- **Understand**: Explain ideas, interpret information
- **Apply**: Use knowledge in new situations
- **Analyze**: Break down complex information
- **Evaluate**: Make judgments, critique
- **Create**: Produce new or original work

### 3. Day-by-Day Structure

Each day should include:

#### Lesson Plan
- **Duration**: Total time (typically 2-4 hours)
- **Learning Objectives**: 2-3 specific goals for the day
- **Bloom's Tags**: Level(s) addressed
- **Agenda**: Step-by-step breakdown
- **Key Concepts**: Main topics covered
- **Activities**: Interactive components
- **Assessment**: How learning is measured

#### Slides (Markdown Format)
- Title slide with module/day info
- Learning objectives slide
- Content slides (max 5-7 points per slide)
- Visual aids descriptions
- Summary slide
- Next steps slide

#### Micro-Video Script
- **Duration**: ≤10 minutes per video
- **Hook**: Engaging opening (first 30 seconds)
- **Learning Objectives**: What viewers will learn
- **Content**: Clear, concise explanations
- **Examples**: Real-world applications
- **Summary**: Key takeaways
- **Call to Action**: What to do next

#### Interactive Exercises
- **Coding Challenges**: Progressive difficulty
- **Quizzes**: Multiple choice, short answer
- **Projects**: Hands-on applications
- **Peer Review**: Collaborative activities
- **Reflection Questions**: Metacognitive prompts

#### Diagrams (ASCII/Text-based)
- Concept maps
- Flowcharts
- System architectures
- Process diagrams
- Relationship graphs

#### Micro-Learning Chunks
- **Duration**: ≤10 minutes each
- **Focus**: Single concept or skill
- **Format**: Video, reading, exercise, or combination
- **Assessment**: Quick check for understanding

### 4. Final Project

- **Description**: Comprehensive project description
- **Requirements**: Specific deliverables
- **Timeline**: Suggested completion schedule
- **Resources**: Tools, libraries, documentation
- **Submission Guidelines**: Format, deadline, process

### 5. Rubric

Assessment criteria should include:

- **Technical Accuracy**: Correctness of implementation
- **Code Quality**: Clean, readable, well-documented
- **Problem Solving**: Approach and methodology
- **Creativity**: Innovation and originality
- **Documentation**: Clear explanations and comments
- **Presentation**: Communication of results

Use a 4-point scale:
- **Exemplary (4)**: Exceeds expectations
- **Proficient (3)**: Meets expectations
- **Developing (2)**: Partially meets expectations
- **Beginning (1)**: Does not meet expectations

## Content Guidelines

### Clarity
- Use simple, clear language
- Define technical terms on first use
- Provide examples for abstract concepts
- Use analogies when appropriate

### Engagement
- Start with real-world problems
- Include interactive elements
- Vary content types (text, video, exercises)
- Provide immediate feedback

### Progression
- Build from simple to complex
- Reinforce previous concepts
- Connect new ideas to existing knowledge
- Scaffold learning appropriately

### Accessibility
- Provide multiple formats
- Include alt text for diagrams
- Use clear headings and structure
- Ensure readability

## Assessment Strategy

### Formative Assessment
- Quick checks during lessons
- Practice exercises
- Peer discussions
- Self-reflection prompts

### Summative Assessment
- End-of-day quizzes
- Weekly projects
- Final comprehensive project
- Portfolio submissions

## Best Practices

1. **Chunking**: Break content into digestible pieces
2. **Spacing**: Distribute practice over time
3. **Retrieval**: Include frequent recall activities
4. **Interleaving**: Mix different topics/concepts
5. **Elaboration**: Encourage deep processing
6. **Dual Coding**: Combine verbal and visual information
7. **Metacognition**: Help learners think about thinking

## Technology Integration

- Use appropriate tools for the learning objective
- Provide clear setup instructions
- Include troubleshooting guides
- Offer alternative tools when possible

## Feedback Mechanisms

- Automated feedback for exercises
- Peer review opportunities
- Instructor feedback points
- Self-assessment tools
